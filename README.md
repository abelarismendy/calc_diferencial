# calc_diferencial

This is a Python project that uses matplotlib to visualize and calculate the area under a curve using the left and right rectangle method.

## Dependencies

The following packages are required to run this application:

- numpy
- matplotlib

## Output

The application will generate a series of images in the `img` folder showing the rectangles used to approximate the area under the curve for different values of `n`. The images will also show the calculated area.

Here is an example of one of the generated images:

![n=10](img/10.png)
